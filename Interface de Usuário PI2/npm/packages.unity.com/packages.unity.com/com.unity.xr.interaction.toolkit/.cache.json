        "changelog": "> [!WARNING]\n> Some serialized fields used by deprecated code were removed with this version. To avoid potential data loss, especially if you were getting warnings about using deprecated functionality, update your project to the latest 2.x version of this package (for example, 2.5.2) before updating your project to version 3.0.\n\n### Added\n- Added a new type of teleport interactable, [Teleportation Multi-Anchor Volume](../manual/teleportation-multi-anchor-volume.md), that enables teleportation to one of several destination poses chosen by a filter object that implements `ITeleportationVolumeAnchorFilter`.\n  - Added `FurthestTeleportationAnchorFilter`, which is the default filter that chooses the furthest anchor as the destination. Use the menu item **Assets > Create > XR > Locomotion > Furthest Teleportation Anchor Filter** to create an instance of this filter.\n  - Added `GazeTeleportationAnchorFilter`, which chooses a destination based on where the user is looking and how far away the anchor is. Use the menu item **Assets > Create > XR > Locomotion > Gaze Teleportation Anchor Filter** to create an instance of this filter.\n  - Added menu item **Assets > Create > XR > Locomotion > Teleport Volume Destination Settings**, which creates a Teleport Volume Destination Settings Datum asset.\n  - Added `Multi Floor Ladder` prefab to the Starter Assets sample, and added an instance of this prefab to the `Climb Sample` prefab. This prefab includes another ladder Climb Interactable and a Teleportation Multi-Anchor Volume that uses a Gaze Teleportation Anchor Filter to teleport to one of three destinations.\n- Added the interface `IXRInteractableCustomReticle`, which allows a component on an interactable's **Custom Reticle** prefab to respond to the interactable instantiating the reticle and attaching it to an instance of `IXRCustomReticleProvider`.\n  - Added an example implementation of this interface in the new `Climb Teleport Reticle` prefab in the Starter Assets sample.\n- Added a rotation threshold to `XRScreenSpaceController` so that scaling is not triggered while rotating.\n- Added in-editor touchscreen gesture support for rotation and scaling in the starter assets. The input action map now has bindings for the related gestures.\n- Added Climb Teleport Interactor, which enables assistance with climb locomotion by teleporting the user to a specific destination when they end a climb interaction.\n  - Added the property **Climb Assistance Teleport Volume** to Climb Interactable to enable this teleportation behavior for a specific climb interactable.\n  - Made the following changes to the Starter Assets sample to demonstrate climb teleportation:\n    - Added a Climb Teleport Interactor instance in the `XR Origin (XR Rig)` prefab under **Locomotion System** > **Climb**.\n    - Assigned the **Climb Assistance Teleport Volume** references in the `Single Floor Ladder` and `Multi Floor Ladder` prefabs.\n    - Added the affordance component Climb Teleport Destination Indicator, and added an instance of this component to the `XR Origin (XR Rig)` prefab.\n    - Added the `Climb Teleport Arrow` prefab and supporting assets.\n- Added public members `climbAnchorInteractable`, `climbAnchorInteractor`, and `climbAnchorUpdated` to `ClimbProvider`.\n- Added public method `Angle(in Vector3, in Vector3, out float)`, which finds the angle between two vectors, to `BurstMathUtility`.\n- Added functionality to `SortingHelpers`\n  - Added `IInteractorDistanceEvaluator` to be able to define the method used to determine the distances between interactables and an interactor which serves to rank the interactables during a sort.\n  - Added in place interactable sorting methods.\n  - Added delegate to be able to define the method used to determine the distances between interactables and an interactor which serves to rank the interactables during a sort.\n  - Added in place interactable sorting methods.\n- Added `IAttachPointVelocityProvider`, `IAttachPointVelocityTracker`, and `AttachPointVelocityTracker` to make the attach point velocity tracking functionality accessible outside of the `XRBaseInteractor`.\n- Added a new type of component, XR Body Transformer, which manages queued `IXRBodyTransformation`s to apply to the XR Origin. This component supplies an `IXRBodyPositionEvaluator` to transformations so that they can use the user's body as a frame of reference. By default the body position is estimated to be directly underneath the camera. Transformations can also use an optional `IConstrainedXRBodyManipulator` to apply movement constrained by collision.\n  - Added a new type of scriptable object, Character Controller XR Body Manipulator, which implements `IConstrainedXRBodyManipulator` by using a Character Controller that matches the user's body position and height.\n  - Added the following implementations of `IXRBodyTransformation`: `DelegateXRBodyTransformation`, `XROriginMovement`, `XRBodyGroundPosition`, `XROriginUpAlignment`, `XRBodyYawRotation`, `XRCameraForwardXZAlignment`, and `XRBodyScale`.\n- Added `handedness` property to interactors to allow you to specify if the interactor is for the left or right hand. Interactables are able to make use of it for custom functionality when they need to know which hand (if any) the interactor is associated with. Also added extension methods to interactables related to this property: `IXRSelectInteractable.IsSelectedByLeft`, `IXRSelectInteractable.IsSelectedByRight`, `IXRHoverInteractable.IsHoveredByLeft`, and `IXRHoverInteractable.IsHoveredByRight`.\n\n### Changed\n- Changed `IXRInteractor` to add a new `handedness` property to allow you to specify if the interactor is for the left or right hand. The property was added to `XRBaseInteractor` and the prefabs in the Starter Assets sample were updated to initialize it. Users with existing prefabs may want to set the value so that they can make use of it in interactable scripts. Users with custom interactor scripts that do not derive from the base class will need to add it to their class implementation.\n- Changed setup of the ladder and elevated teleport area in the `Climb Sample` prefab in the Starter Assets sample so that the objects are set up in a new `Single Floor Ladder` prefab. This prefab also contains a Teleportation Multi-Anchor Volume to allow teleportation to the top or bottom, whichever is furthest from the user.\n- Changed `XRPokeInteractor` to use `IAttachPointVelocityTracker` instead of the velocity tracking that used to live in `XRBaseInteractor`.\n- Changed `XRTransformStabilizer`\n  - Core logic to compute stabilization is now done in a public static method so that external classes can use it like a utilities library.\n  - Fixed local transformation logic.\n- Optimized included bubbles sort function from `SortingHelpers`.\n- Changed how Two-Handed Grab Move Provider applies rotation and scaling of the XR Origin. Rotation and scaling now happen around the user's body position (the camera position projected onto the XZ plane of the XR Origin) instead of the XR Origin's position.\n- Changed core locomotion system to place less responsibility on provider implementations to manage state changes and allow greater configurability of the order in which providers apply transformations to the XR Origin. Each provider's locomotion state is now centrally maintained by the Locomotion Mediator based on requests for the XR Body Transformer linked to the mediator.\n  - Replaced the now deprecated `LocomotionSystem` with `LocomotionMediator`.\n  - Replaced the now deprecated `LocomotionPhase` with `LocomotionState`.\n  - Deprecated several members of `LocomotionProvider` and added new members in their place for communicating with the Locomotion Mediator and providing information for state changes. Deprecated members include: `beginLocomotion`, `endLocomotion`, `CanBeginLocomotion`, `BeginLocomotion`, and `EndLocomotion`.\n  - Changed timing of when Locomotion Providers apply transformations to the XR Origin. Now in each Provider's `Update`, rather than applying the transformation immediately the Provider queues its transformation into the XR Body Transformer. Transformations are applied in queue order in the XR Body Transformer's `Update`, which occurs later in the same frame.\n  - Changed timing of when `ContinuousMoveProvider`, `ConstrainedMoveProvider`, and `ContinuousTurnProvider` invoke locomotion events, for consistency with other providers. Now these providers invoke `locomotionStarted` when the start of move input occurs (e.g. thumbstick is moved from rest state) and `locomotionEnded` when the end of move input occurs (e.g. thumbstick is released). \n- Changed the move speed in the `XR Origin (XR Rig)` prefab in the Starter Assets sample from `1` to `2.5`.\n- Changed default value of [`UIInputModule.trackedDeviceDragThresholdMultiplier`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.UI.UIInputModule.trackedDeviceDragThresholdMultiplier) from `1.4` to `2` and updated the preset in the Starter Assets sample to match.\n- Changed `XRControllerRecorder.GetControllerState` so it only returns a valid value when playing or recording. Also changed so the `out` param is returned `null` instead of allocating when the method returns `false`.\n- Renamed `ActionBasedControllerManager` to `ControllerInputActionManager` in Starter Assets sample.\n- Changed `ControllerInputActionManager` to no longer add or modify interactors in the XR Interaction Group. The prefab in Starter Assets is already configured to what it would try to change it to.\n- Changed the default execution order of `ControllerInputActionManager` back to the default and added an `Update` method instead of creating a coroutine.\n- Renamed Anchor Control in XR Ray Interactor to Attach Transform Manipulation to make it more apparent that it is for manipulating the Attach Transform. Also renamed related properties to make it match the display name in the Inspector window.\n  - Renamed `allowAnchorControl` property to `manipulateAttachTransform`.\n  - Renamed `anchorRotateReferenceFrame` property to `rotateReferenceFrame`.\n  - Renamed `anchorRotationMode` property to `rotateMode`.\n  - Renamed `AnchorRotationMode` enum to `RotateMode`.\n  - Renamed `RotateAnchor` method to `RotateAttachTransform`.\n  - Renamed `TranslateAnchor` method to `TranslateAttachTransform`.\n  - Renamed corresponding properties in the `XRRayInteractorEditor`.\n- Renamed `ScaleMode.Input` to `ScaleMode.ScaleOverTime`.\n- Renamed `ScaleMode.Distance` to `ScaleMode.DistanceDelta`.\n- Renamed Enable Interaction with UI GameObjects on XR Ray Interactor to UI Interaction.\n- Changed the created hierarchy of GameObjects for the XR Origin from the **GameObject** &gt; **XR** menu to no longer include interactors and tweaked some settings for the Mobile AR variant.\n- Changed `XRDirectInteractorEditor` so the Selection Configuration properties are drawn in a foldout. The properties are now drawn in a new `DrawSelectionConfigurationNested` method which the previously defined `DrawSelectionConfiguration` calls into after drawing the foldout.\n\n### Deprecated\n- Deprecated code and serialized fields from XRI 1.x.x are now treated as errors.\n- Deprecation of `AttachPointCompatibilityMode` enum and `XRGrabInteractable.attachPointCompatibilityMode` along with `XRLegacyGrabTransformer` are now treated as errors.\n- Deprecated old way of handling AR Interaction. Download the AR Stater Assets for a full demo scene using the new architecture.\n- The Affordance System namespace and all associated classes have been deprecated. The existing affordance system will be moved, replaced, and updated with a new interaction feedback system in a future version of XRI.\n- Deprecated Character Controller Driver. Instead enable the **Use Character Controller** property under the **Constrained Movement Settings** on the XR Body Transformer.\n- Deprecated exclusive access and timeout behavior of the Locomotion System.\n- Deprecated controller classes (`XRBaseController`, `ActionBasedController`, `XRController`, and `XRScreenSpaceController`) and their corresponding Editor classes. Inputs needed for each interactor are now directly serialized with the interactor. The Transform position and rotation can instead be driven by the Tracked Pose Driver (Input System) component. The model can be instantiated with a custom script or directly added to the XR Origin prefab. These components will no longer appear in the **Component** &gt; **XR** &gt; **Locomotion** menu or in the **Add Component** menu in the Inspector window.\n- Deprecated `InputHelpers`. The values from the XR `InputDevice` class can be read using the new input readers contained in the `Legacy XR Input Readers` sample instead.\n- Deprecated Action-based and Device-based locomotion components. These components will no longer appear in the **Component** &gt; **XR** &gt; **Locomotion** menu or in the **Add Component** menu in the Inspector window.\n  - `ActionBasedContinuousMoveProvider` and `DeviceBasedContinuousMoveProvider` should be replaced with [`ContinuousMoveProvider`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Locomotion.ContinuousMoveProvider).\n  - `ActionBasedContinuousTurnProvider` and `DeviceBasedContinuousTurnProvider` should be replaced with [`ContinuousTurnProvider`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Locomotion.ContinuousTurnProvider).\n  - `ActionBasedSnapTurnProvider` and `DeviceBasedSnapTurnProvider` should be replaced with [`SnapTurnProvider`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Locomotion.SnapTurnProvider).\n  - `GrabMoveProvider.grabMoveAction` should be replaced with [`GrabMoveProvider.grabMoveInput`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.GrabMoveProvider.grabMoveInput).\n- Deprecated `XRBaseControllerInteractor` and replaced with [`XRBaseInputInteractor`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.XRBaseInputInteractor).\n- Deprecated `XRBaseControllerInteractorEditor` and replaced with `XRBaseInputInteractorEditor`.\n  - Deprecated `XRBaseControllerInteractorEditor.BaseControllerContents` and replaced with `XRBaseInputInteractorEditor.BaseInputContents`.\n- Deprecated `XRBaseInputInteractor.hideControllerOnSelect` since it depended on the deprecated XR Controller (Action-based) or XR Controller (Device-based) component. You can use the Select Entered and Select Exited events to deactivate/activate the controller model GameObject instead.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed menu items for Action-based and Device-based components from the **GameObject** &gt; **XR** menu.\n- Removed menu item for Locomotion System from the **GameObject** &gt; **XR** menu.\n- Removed the backing serialized field (`m_System`) for `LocomotionProvider.system` to avoid it appearing in the Inspector window since `LocomotionSystem` is now deprecated. Users that referenced a specific Locomotion System instance when there were multiple in the scene will now need to move it to the GameObject or parent GameObject of the Locomotion Provider or manually set the property during runtime if they wish to continue using it. If there is only a single Locomotion System component, the provider will automatically find it during Awake.\n- Removed presets for deprecated components from the Starter Assets sample.\n- Removed Meta Gaze Adapter sample.\n- Removed [XR Legacy Input Helpers (com.unity.xr.legacyinputhelpers)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.legacyinputhelpers@2.1/) package from dependencies. If you are making use of the pose provider override on the deprecated XR Controller component, you will need to ensure this package is added to your project.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed issue where rotating on vertical planes with the `ARTransformer` would snap to an unintended rotation.\n- Fixed failing unit tests caused by introduction of global actions in Input System 1.8.0.\n- Fixed a math error in the `XRDistanceEvaluator` where `CalculateNormalizedScore` would return an incorrect score."

        "changelog": "### Added\n- Added the canvas optimizer to reduce runtime load of UI-heavy scenes. See [UI Setup - Canvas optimizer](../manual/ui-setup.md#canvas-optimizer) in the manual for more details.\n- Added the [`ARTransformer`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.ARTransformer) which allows users to move an `XRGrabInteractable` while constrained to AR Foundation planes. It also has functionality for scaling with touch pinch gestures when the XR Screen Space Controller is used.\n- Added Track Scale and related smoothing options to XR Grab Interactable to allow developers to disable writing to the object's scale when grabbing.\n- Added snap transformations to `XRSocketInteractor` on hover.\n- Added scaling transformation to `XRSocketInteractor`.\n- Added several scripts to the Starter Assets sample for object spawning in AR: `ObjectSpawner`, `ARInteractorSpawnTrigger`, `ARContactSpawnTrigger`, and `DestroySelf`.\n- Added an AR demo scene to the AR Starter Assets that displays a set-up for mobile AR which includes a sliding menu of placeable and interactable objects.\n- Added `GetCurrentGameObject` method to `UIInputModule` to get the UI GameObject currently being hovered by a tracked device or pointer device such as a mouse or touchscreen.\n- Added Cone Cast hit detection type to the [XR Ray Interactor](../manual/xr-ray-interactor.md) to allow users to select small objects at a distance easily.\n- Added ray endpoint stabilization to the [XR Transform Stabilizer](../manual/xr-transform-stabilizer.md).\n- Added [XR Hand Skeleton Poke Displacer](../manual/xr-hand-skeleton-poke-displacer.md) component to allow for displacing the hand skeleton when poking an interactable in order to prevent the hand from phasing through objects while poking them.\n- Added one handed scaling support to XR General Grab Transformer to allow grab interactables to be scaled, controlled by enabling Allow One Handed Scaling (which is enabled by default). For motion controller scaling with the XR Ray Interactor, Scale Mode (which is None by default) should be set to Input. For pinch scaling with the XR Ray Interactor, Scale Mode should be set to Distance.\n- Added new Scale Toggle and Scale Delta input actions to the XR Controller (Action-based) which the XR Ray Interactor reads. The `XRRayInteractor` implements the new [`IXRScaleValueProvider`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.IXRScaleValueProvider) by reading the scale delta values from the `ActionBasedController` or `XRScreenSpaceController` so that the `XRGeneralGrbTransformer` can scale using the controller and `ARTransformer` can be used to scale objects with touch pinch gestures.\n\n### Changed\n- The Tunneling Vignette sample was moved into the Starter Assets sample.\n- Changed the Starter Assets sample to be reorganized so all `DemoScene` assets are located in a separate `DemoSceneAssets` folder that can be easily removed.\n- Changed the automatic creation of the XR Device Simulator prefab to be excluded from standalone builds by default. A new **Instantiate In Editor Only** setting to control this behavior was added to the XR Interaction Toolkit project settings. ([XRIT-82](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-82))\n- Changed the Ray Interactor prefab in the Starter Assets sample to use cone casting instead of ray casting for the hit detection type.\n- Changed the XR Controller (Action-based) components in the Starter Assets sample to have empty action references instead of empty input actions for consistency and to avoid potential errors during the `ApplyProcessors` method of the current latest version of Input System.\n- Converted math in XR General Grab Transformer to use the Burst compiler and the Mathematics package for performance improvements.\n- Project Validation will automatically open if there are validation errors or missing dependencies to correct when importing [Hands Interaction Demo](../manual/samples.md#hands-interaction-demo) sample package.\n- Converted math in XR Grab Interactable related to smoothing operations to use the Burst compiler and the Mathematics package for performance improvements.\n- Changed `XRGrabInteractable` default property values:\n  - Changed default value of `smoothPositionAmount` and `smoothRotationAmount` from `5` to `8`.\n  - Changed default value of `tightenPosition` and `tightenRotation` from `0.5` to `0.1`.\n- Changed `com.unity.xr.core-utils` dependency from 2.2.1 to 2.2.3.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue where a teleport aim reticle would not rotate to point forward when the interactor ray origin rotated if the interactor was just hovering and not yet selecting.\n- Fixed compiler warnings for use of `FindObjectOfType` and `FindObjectsOfType` by conditionally using the newer methods `FindAnyObjectByType` and `FindObjectsByType` for Unity 2023.1 and newer.\n- Fixed the AR Configuration Inspector foldout in XR Ray Interactor to keep expanded state when clicking between GameObjects."

        "changelog": "### Added\n- Added hands support to XR Device Simulator. You must have the [XR Hands package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.xr.hands.html) installed in your project to use this new functionality.\n- Added Is Tracked action to XR Controller (Action-based), and updated presets and prefabs in Starter Assets sample to make use of the new Is Tracked input actions in the `XRI Default Input Actions`.\n- Added properties in the [`ARGestureInteractor`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.AR.ARGestureInteractor) class to control raycast behavior for gestures.\n- Added the `IXRPokeFilter` interface to allow other classes to act as customized poke filters for the `XRPokeInteractor` instead of only supporting the `XRPokeFilter` component.\n- Added XR Interactor Affordance State Provider component which can drive affordance receivers using interactor interactions events.\n- Added Color Gradient Line Renderer Affordance Receiver to pair with an XR Interactor Affordance State Provider on a Ray interactor to improve visual coloring. Has a property to automatically disable coloring of XR Interactor Line Visual.\n- Added [Hand Menu](../manual/hand-menu.md) component, as well as a sample prefab of a working hand menu in the Hands Interaction Demo sample.\n  - `HandMenu` component has a split configuration for hands and controllers, with a new `FollowPresetDatum`. \n  - Added gaze activation settings and a reveal/ hide hand menu animation.\n- Added [XR Input Modality Manager](../manual/xr-input-modality-manager.md) component which manages swapping between hand and controller hierarchies in the XR Origin. Updated prefabs in the package samples to make use of this component.\n- Added ability for XR Interactor Line Visual to curve accurately and track interactable attach points during selection.\n- Added Auto Adjust Line Length property to XR Interactor Line Visual to retract the line end after a delay when the ray interactor doesn't hit any valid targets.\n- Added the [XR Gaze Assistance](../manual/xr-gaze-assistance.md) component to enable split interaction. Eye for aiming and controllers for selection.\n- Added the [`IXRRayProvider`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.IXRRayProvider) interface to allow other ray implementations to take advantage of split interaction.\n- Added `Focus State` to interactables. An interactable that is selected is also focused; it remains focused until another interactable is focused instead. Useful for highlighting an object to later perform operations on.\n- Added Visit Each Frame property to XR Controller Recorder to control whether each frame of the input recording must be played back regardless of the time period passed.\n- Added [XR Transform Stabilizer](../manual/xr-transform-stabilizer.md) component that applies optimized stabilization techniques to remove pose jitter and makes aiming and selecting with rays easier for users. \n- Added Climb Provider, which provides locomotion counter to interactor movement while the user is selecting a Climb Interactable.\n  - Added menu item **Assets > Create > XR > Locomotion > Climb Settings**, which creates a Climb Settings Datum asset.\n  - Added a Climb Provider instance to `XR Origin Preconfigured` in the Starter Assets sample.\n  - Added `Climb Sample` prefab to the Starter Assets sample, and added an instance of this prefab to `DemoScene`. This prefab includes preconfigured Climb Interactables.\n- Added support for XRRayInteractors to scroll UI panels using the thumbstick.\n  - IUInteractors now support UIHoverEnter and UIHoverExit events.\n  - UIInputModule gains the trackedScrollDeltaMultiplier property to control scrolling speeds via thumbstick.\n  - TrackedDeviceModel gains properties for current UI Selectable and if the selected UI is scrollable.\n  - ActionBasedController gains a property for UI scrolling input, set to the thumbstick in the starter assets.\n- Added configuration of interaction overrides to XR Interaction Group, allowing certain Group members to take control of interaction when attempting to select, regardless of priority.\n- Added Direct Interactor as an interaction override for Poke Interactor in each XR Interaction Group in `XR Origin (XR Rig)` in Starter Assets sample.\n- Added new Shader Graphs and Materials in `Hand Interaction Demo` for a transparent hand that supports highlighting fingers\n- Added the [`TouchscreenGestureInputController`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.AR.Inputs.TouchscreenGestureInputController) which allows users to surface touchscreen gesture data via the Input System.\n- Added the [`XRScreenSpaceController`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.XRScreenSpaceController) which enables usage of screenspace input, from touchscreen or mouse, with interactors.\n- Added the `enableARRaycasting` property to [`XRRayInteractor`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.XRRayInteractor) which enables raycasting against the AR environment if AR Foundation is installed.\n\n### Changed\n- Changed [`XRControllerState`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.XRControllerState) by adding an `isTracked` field. Deprecated old constructors, users should update their code to call the ones with the added parameter.\n- Changed XRI project validation to only log errors to the console, not warnings.\n- Changed XR Interactor Line Visual so it bends to the selected interactable by default. Set **Line Bend Ratio** to **1** to revert to the old behavior where the line would remain straight.\n- Changed XR Interactor Line Visual default value of Line Width from 0.02 to 0.005.\n- Improved performance of the line visual and ray interactor by optimizing most of the line computation math for the Burst compiler. The [Burst package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.burst.html) must be installed in your project to take advantage of the optimizations.\n- Changed `XRInteractorLineVisual` by adding the `OnDestroy` and `LateUpdate` methods. Users who had already implemented either method in derived classes will need to call the base method.\n- Changed `XRInteractorReticleVisual` by adding the `OnDisable` method so it disables the reticle when the component is disabled. Users who had already implemented that method in derived classes will need to call the base method.\n- Changed `TeleportationAnchor.GetAttachTransform` method to return the `teleportAnchorTransform` value.\n- Renamed Starter Assets sample prefabs:\n  - Renamed `Complete XR Origin Set Up` prefab to `XR Interaction Setup`.\n  - Renamed `XR Origin` prefab to `XR Origin (XR Rig)`.\n  - Renamed `Complete Teleport Area Set Up` prefab to `Teleportation Environment`.\n- Renamed Hands Interaction Demo sample prefabs:\n  - Renamed `Complete XR Origin Hands Set Up` prefab to `XR Interaction Hands Setup`.\n  - Renamed `XR Origin Hands` prefab to `XR Origin Hands (XR Rig)`.\n- Changed `XR Origin (XR Rig)` to reorganize locomotion components to new GameObjects.\n- Changed `XR Origin (XR Rig)` to disable grab move locomotion by default. Activate the **Grab Move** GameObject to re-enable that functionality.\n- Changed `XR Origin Hands (XR Rig)` to be a prefab variant of the `XR Origin (XR Rig)` prefab.\n- Changed Starter Assets sample prefabs by adding XR Gaze Fallback to the XR Origin GameObject.\n- Changed `XRRayInteractor`, `XRInteractorLineVisual`, and `XRInteractorReticleVisual` to support mediation through split interaction.\n- Changed XR Ray Interactor to no longer interact with UGUI Canvases while selecting an interactable.\n- Changed XR Ray Interactor so the Hover To Select property will now activate with UI elements.\n- Changed `com.unity.inputsystem` dependency from 1.4.4 to 1.5.0.\n- Changed `com.unity.xr.core-utils` dependency from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1.\n- Changed lowest supported Unity Editor version of XR Interaction Toolkit to 2021.3 now that 2020.3 has reached End of Life.\n- Changed `XRPokeLogic` to resolve an issue where starting a poke from behind the object can trigger select.\n- Updated the Hands Interaction Demo with new interaction reactive visuals:\n  - Changed the required version of `com.unity.xr.hands` for the Hands Interaction Demo sample from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0.\n  - Changed the `XR Origin Hands (XR Rig)` prefab to use prefabs for each hand visual with affordances to highlight the fingers during interaction.\n  - Changed the hands model to use new components in `com.unity.xr.hands` to subscribe and expose hand tracking events: `XRHandsSkeletonDriver`, `XRHandTrackingEvents`, and `XRHandMeshController`.\n- Added Sphere Collider optimized accuracy improvement for Direct Interactor that improves inter-frame reliability and latency.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed `HandsAndControllersManager` script from the Hands Interaction Demo sample and moved it into the package as [`XRInputModalityManager`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Inputs.XRInputModalityManager).\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed XR Grab Interactables interfering with player movement by using `Physics.IgnoreCollision` to prevent collision between the Character Controller and the grabbed object's colliders.\n- Fixed the Input Devices tab in the [XR Interaction Debugger window](../manual/debugger-window.md) so it doesn't rebuild the tree every Editor frame. This allows the input devices to be collapsed. Added additional columns.\n- Fixed the teleport ray interactor getting stuck on after a teleport completes when the GameObject with the Action Based Controller Manager component was deactivated.\n- Fixed XR Interactor Line Visual not working with Teleportation Anchor when an XR Interactable Snap Volume is used by no longer skipping the snapping behavior when the ray interactor has a selection. Use the Disable Snap Collider When Selected property of XR Interactable Snap Volume to control that behavior.\n- Fixed bugs in Lazy Follow where threshold mechanics weren't being respected, and reworked class to leverage [`SmartFollowVector3TweenableVariable`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Utilities.Tweenables.SmartTweenableVariables.SmartFollowVector3TweenableVariable) and [`SmartFollowQuaternionTweenableVariable`](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Utilities.Tweenables.SmartTweenableVariables.SmartFollowQuaternionTweenableVariable).\n- Fixed bug with PokeFollowAffordance sample script that did not work when using two hands on the same canvas.\n- Fixed so poke objects will push to the larger depth when both hands are poking at the same time.\n- Fixed an issue in the `ActionBasedControllerManager` that would cause a null-reference exception if the Direct or Ray interactors were not assigned. ([XRIT-72](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-72))\n- Fixed an issue with the state-change of the `XRInteractableAffordanceStateProvider` that would trigger Select and Hover effects when currently Activated and `ignoreActivateEvents` was set to true or Hover effects when actively Selected and `ignoreSelectEvents` was set to true.\n- Fixed an Array Out of Bounds error when using Affordance Themes when accessing the last element in the list of states.\n- Fixed an issue with `XRPokeLogic` where starting a poke from behind the object can trigger select."

        "changelog": "### Added\n- Added System Gesture Detector component to the Hands Interaction Demo sample to add system gesture and menu palm pinch gesture events. Added sound upon menu press as an example. Added Aim Flags input actions to the `XRI Default Input Actions` in the Starter Assets sample to support this.\n- Added [Interaction filters](../manual/interaction-filters.md) documentation for `IXRHoverFilter`, `IXRSelectFilter`, `IXRInteractionStrengthFilter`, and the corresponding filter delegates with examples.\n\n### Changed\n- Changed the Poke Gesture Detector component in the Hands Interaction Demo sample to no longer end the poke gesture when hand tracking is lost. This fixes the Ray Interactor line visual reappearing when hand tracking is lost while doing the poke gesture.\n- Changed `XRInteractorReticleVisual` to ensure consistent attempts to align the reticle prefab's `z` axis with the `transform.up` of the XROrigin when `AlignPrefabWithSurfaceNormal` is `true` and aligning with a non-horizontal surface.\n- Changed `XRInteractorReticleVisual` to align the reticle prefab's `z` axis with the forward direction of the reticle's interactor when `AlignPrefabWithSurfaceNormal` is `true` and aligning with a horizontal surface.\n- Updated installation documentation with convenience links for installing the XRI package on older versions of Unity 2021 where the package was not included in the main Editor manifest.\n- Changed so UGUI poke interactions are now considered to be blocking interactions for interaction groups. This allows rays to be properly hidden when hovering or selecting a UGUI canvas with poke.\n- Changed to use velocity estimation of poke interactor to add an extra validation mechanism in the XR Poke Filter hover validation check to allow poke selection to occur in cases where it was previously rejected, while still preventing poking from behind and other non-desireable cases.\n- Changed to cache poke selection validation check so that it's easier to hold a poke when the selection conditions are met. This makes scrolling UGUI canvases easier and makes poke interactions feel more consistent.\n- Changed AR Scale Interactable so changing the Min Scale and/or Max Scale during runtime will keep the current object scale if still within range instead of resizing the object to keep the same scale ratio.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the Hands Interaction Demo sample to wait to activate the controller GameObjects until they are reconnected instead of each time hand tracking is lost. Also fixed the controllers appearing at the origin if they have never been tracked.\n- Fixed the Hands Interaction Demo sample so it disables the hand interactors while doing a system gesture (such as a user looking at their open palm at eye level).\n- Fixed warning about a self-intersecting polygon in the `Frame.fbx` model in the Hands Interaction Demo sample.\n- Fixed warning in Hands Interaction Demo sample about obsolete API usage coming from the hands subsystem. \n- Fixed `XRSimulatedController` and `XRSimulatedHMD` to have identifying characteristics information in the `capabilities` field of their corresponding `InputDeviceDescription`. ([XRIT-50](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-50))\n- Fixed an issue in the `XRController` class where the `inputDevice` property was not reinitialized when the `controllerNode` property was changed. ([XRIT-52](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-52))\n- UGUI ray interactions are now correctly blocked when interaction groups block ray interactions and the ray is hidden.\n- Fixed an issue with `TrackedDeviceGraphicRaycaster`, when using the `XRPokeInteractor` on UGUI canvases with different sort orders, where interaction was blocked on all but the highest Order in Layer valued canvas. ([XRIT-48](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-48))\n- Fixed an issue with `TrackedDeviceGraphicsRaycaster`, where opening a dropdown would block all other UGUI canvases to become non-interactable with an `XRPokeInteractor` until the dropdown was closed.\n- Fixed the `Starter Assets` and `Hands Interaction Demo` prefabs which contained components and shaders with a mix of both Built-in Render Pipeline and Universal Render Pipeline. They are all now using Built-in Render Pipeline for consistency.\n- Fixed `XRInteractorReticleVisual` incorrect rotation around `y` axis when aligning prefab to surface normal. ([XRIT-18](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/XRIT-18))\n- Fixed `XRInteractorReticleVisual` incorrect rotation when `AlignPrefabWithSurfaceNormal` is `false`.\n- Fixed `XRInteractorReticleVisual` inconsistent rotation when `AlignPrefabWithSurfaceNormal` and `DrawOnNoHit` are `true` but there is no active hit.\n- Fixed `UIInputModule` issue where tracked devices cannot drag on UI elements when `Cursor.lockState` is set to `Locked`."

This allows a user to set Raycast Trigger Interaction to Ignore but still collide with trigger colliders that are associated with a snap volume.\n- Added options to XR Poke Follow Affordance in the Starter Assets sample to apply the follow animation if the poke target is a child and to clamp the follow target to a maximum distance from the poke target.\n- Added an XR Poke Follow Affordance to the `TextButton` prefab in the Starter Assets sample so that the button graphics can move in response to poke.\n- Added Tracking State and Is Tracked input actions to the `XRI Default Input Actions` in the Starter Assets sample.\n- Added [Meta Gaze Adapter](../manual/samples.md#meta-gaze-adapter) sample to allow developers to request permission and initialize eye tracking for the Meta Quest Pro.\n- Added [Hands Interaction Demo](../manual/samples.md#hands-interaction-demo) sample to demonstrate interactions with hand tracking.\n- Added poke interaction examples to the `DemoScene` in the Starter Assets sample.\n- Added ability to customize the layer mask and trigger interaction when the XR Poke Interactor performs the physics sphere overlap call.\n- Added documentation regarding behavior when Select Action Trigger is set to State on XR Direct Interactor and XR Ray Interactor.\n\n### Changed\n- Changed the Stop Manipulation action (default binding `Escape`) in the XR Device Simulator to always stop manipulation every time it is pressed instead of cycling between None and FPS mode. Trigger the Cycle Devices action (default binding `Tab`) to switch back to FPS mode instead.\n- Changed `Ray Interactor` prefab in the Starter Assets sample to enable Treat Selection As Valid State on the XR Interactor Line Visual.\n- Changed the  **GameObject** &gt; **XR** &gt; **Grab Interactable** menu item to set the Rigidbody Interpolate property on the created GameObject to Interpolate.\n- Changed the Rigidbody Interpolate property from None to Interpolate in each of the Starter Assets sample grab interactable prefabs.\n- Changed the default value of the Color Property Name property on the Color Material Property Affordance Receiver component to an empty string instead of `\"_BaseColor\"`. An empty string will now use either `\"_BaseColor\"` or `\"_Color\"` depending on the current render pipeline to add support for the Built-In Render Pipeline.\n- Changed `GetValidTargets` on each interactor type to return an empty list when the interactor is disabled.\n- Changed `ActionBasedControllerManager` in Starter Assets sample to make use of XR Interaction Group and removed some unused serialized fields.\n- Changed `XR Origin Preconfigured` in Starter Assets sample so it instantiates the controller model prefab at runtime instead of being in the prefab hierarchy to make it easier for users to override the model used.\n- Changed `Teleport Interactor` in Starter Assets sample so it instantiates the reticle prefabs at runtime instead of being in the prefab hierarchy to make it easier for users to override the reticle used.\n- Changed `com.unity.xr.core-utils` dependency to 2.2.0.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed Teleportation Anchor incorrectly triggering a teleport when the Ray Interactor stops pointing at the anchor when it no longer has any ray cast hits.\n- Fixed Starter Assets sample prefabs and `DemoScene` to have the Gaze Interactor prefab.\n- Fixed `XRPokeInteractor` so it uses the `targetFilter` for filtering the valid targets returned by `GetValidTargets`.\n- Fixed the Fix button for project validation issue \"Interaction Layer 31 is not set to 'Teleport'\" not persisting to the settings asset when closing the Unity Editor.\n- Fixed missing references in device simulator UI button images by assigning to null.\n- Fixed the `PokeStateData` that is generated from UI poke interaction so that its `axisAlignedPokeInteractionPoint` is relative to the world position of the target transform.\n- Fixed broken click animations in `XRInteractableAffordanceStateProvider`.\n- Fixed XR Device Simulator so it will use the new main camera if the previous one is disabled or destroyed.\n- Fixed issue where AR gestures did not take into account UI in `ARBaseGestureInteractable` behaviors (such as AR Placement Interactable) by adding an `excludeUITouches` property, which is enabled by default.\n- Fixed potential invalid stayed colliders list in `XRDirectInteractor` and `XRSocketInteractor` when the interactor is disabled while in contact with a collider.\n- Fixed hover and select events being incorrectly fired when an `XRDirectInteractor` or `XRSocketInteractor` GameObject or component is disabled while in contact with an interactable, moved away from the interactable, and then enabled.\n- Fixed XR Poke Interactor to query the local [PhysicsScene](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PhysicsScene.html) instead of using static physics calls.\n- Fixed poke in UI scrolling in a scroll view outside of the viewport by ensuring the Tracked Device Graphic Raycaster respects the alpha hit test threshold.\n- Fixed the `Teleport Anchor` prefab in Starter Assets to place the teleport destination at the top of the platform, fixing a bump that would occur when moving with locomotion after teleporting."

        "changelog": "### Added\r\n- Added properties to XR Grab Interactable to use dynamic attach transforms so the grab pose will be based on the pose of the Interactor when the selection is made. You can enable the Use Dynamic Attach property to keep the object in the same position and rotation when grabbed. ([1373337](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1373337))\r\n- Added filtering for interactions to help determine the intent of the user. The new abstractions XR Target Filter and XR Target Evaluator let users configure and extend the logic of how an Interactor ranks an Interactable from a list of valid ones, specifically in the `GetValidTargets` method. Several different evaluators are included in this update, and custom ones can be created. This makes it easier to customize the Interactor without needing to create a derived behavior.\r\n- Added the `XRBaseInteractable.distanceCalculationMode` property. This give users the ability to configure how an Interactable calculates its distance to a location, such as to an Interactor for sorting its valid targets, at varying tradeoffs between accuracy and performance.\r\n- Added the `XRBaseInteractable.getDistanceOverride` property that lets users assign a method to be called when the Interactable is performing a distance calculation to a location, which is used when the Interactor is ordering its valid targets. This property makes it easier to customize the Interactable without needing to create a derived behavior.\r\n- Added `IsOverUIGameObject` function to `XRRayInteractor` that does a simple check to see if the ray cast result is hitting a UI GameObject.\r\n- Added `InputActionReference` properties to the `XRUIInputModule` for left/right/middle clicks, navigation move, submit, cancel, scroll and pointer movement actions. This allows for greater flexibility and customization of what devices can drive UI input when using the `XRUIInputModule`.\r\n- The `XRI Default Input Actions` asset in the `Starter Assets` sample package now includes an `XRI UI` Action Map for UI-specific Input Actions. Also included is a Preset asset to quickly map the actions onto the `XRUIInputModule` component.\r\n- Added a Tunneling Vignette sample. It contains assets to let users set up and configure the tunneling vignette as a comfort mode intended to mitigate motion sickness in VR.\r\n- Added a Tunneling Vignette Controller component used for driving the vignette material included with the Tunneling Vignette sample. Locomotion Provider components can be drag-and-dropped into a list of Locomotion Providers that will trigger the tunneling vignette effect. A custom inspector allows previewing each effect for the corresponding Locomotion Provider.\r\n  * Added `ITunnelingVignetteProvider` interface to allow custom behaviors to control the vignette effect.\r\n  * Added a `LocomotionPhase` enum in `LocomotionProvider` that can be used to describe different phases of a locomotion for use with the tunneling vignette. Added code in `ContinuousMoveProviderBase`, `ContinuousTurnProviderBase`, `SnapTurnProviderBase`, and `TeleportationProvider` to compute their `LocomotionPhase`.\r\n  * Added a Delay Time property to the Teleportation Provider and Snap Turn Provider components to support customization of timing for use with fading in the tunneling vignette.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Updated code paths with macro protections around `InputSystem` or `Input Manager` based code to prevent attempted usage when either one is not active.\r\n- Scroll speed when using the ScrollWheel Input System Action is now being divided by 20 pixels per line instead of 120 pixels per line to match the `InputSystemUIInputModule` scrolling speed.\r\n- Changed `XRSocketInteractor` hover mesh pose calculation to only ignore the current pose of the attach transform for `XRGrabInteractable` when Use Dynamic Attach is disabled instead of for all types of `IXRSelectInteractable`.\r\n- Changed `XRControllerRecorder.recording` from `internal` to `public`.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fixed `UIInputModule` so pointer clicks set the correct button (left/right/middle) for the `EventSystem` in the `PointerEventData`.\r\n- Fixed compilation errors on platforms such as Game Core where `ENABLE_VR` is not currently defined."
